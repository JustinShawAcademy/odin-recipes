# odin-recipes
a website only using HTML. 
The website link to this project is found [here](https://justinshawacademy.github.io/odin-recipes/).

## Core HTML Concepts:
These are the concepts understood from building the project
* **HTML Boilerplate:** Understanding the basic structure of an HTML document, including `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
* **Headings:** Using `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc., to structure content and define hierarchy.
* **Paragraphs:** Using `<p>` tags for blocks of text.
* **Lists:**
    * **Unordered Lists:** Using `<ul>` and `<li>` for ingredients.
    * **Ordered Lists:** Using `<ol>` and `<li>` for recipe steps.
* **Images:** Embedding images using the `<img>` tag with `src` (source) and `alt` (alternative text) attributes.
* **Links (Hyperlinks):** Creating navigation between pages using the `<a>` tag with the `href` (hypertext reference) attribute. This includes:
    * Linking to other pages within your project (relative paths).
    * Linking back to the homepage.
* **File Structure:** Organizing your HTML files within directories (e.g., a "recipes" folder for individual recipe pages) and understanding how to link between them.


This is the first project that is done by following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard).
